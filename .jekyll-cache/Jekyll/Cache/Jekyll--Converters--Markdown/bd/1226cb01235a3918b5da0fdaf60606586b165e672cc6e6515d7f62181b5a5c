<p>Another semester had ended! I finished the most difficult and tensive semester in my academic life, and the result is satisifiying. I didnâ€™t have a lot of time to play games this semester, the one I played most recently is Genshin Impact. I enjoy the combat system and the exquisite characters. The storys, especially for every single character are drawing a astoundingly deep fantacy world. I love the Chinese elements and OST of Liyue too! P.S. Donâ€™t like the gacha part that much :P</p>

<p>Also, congrats to Hades for winning best independent game and action game in TGA! One of the best games I played this year. Good job supergiants!</p>

<p>The semester finally ends, and I got some time to play the games I wanted to play!</p>

<p>I finished playing Katana Zero. Which is amazing! The gameplay is tense and thrilling. The story is attractive, and the way interaction is creative! If you havenâ€™t played it before, donâ€™t miss out!</p>
