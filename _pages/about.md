Hi I'm Chengzhe Li, a CS Master's Student from University of Massachusetts Amherst!  
I'm a developer, a music aficionado, and a gamer! I play guitar and bass after I finished coding, it's the best way to relax for me. 
I'm actively looking for a summer internship for 2021. I have a broad interest includes Systems(Distributed Systems, Operating Systems, System for Machine Learning, etc..), Networking, Graphics and Visions, and game programming(Client side, server side, and engine). 
I love to think and create interesting stuffs not limited by category, I also enjoy learning new skills and the feeling of making progress.
