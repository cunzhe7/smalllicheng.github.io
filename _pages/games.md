Another semester had ended! I finished the most difficult and tensive semester in my academic life, and the result is satisifiying. I didn't have a lot of time to play games this semester, the one I played most recently is Genshin Impact. I enjoy the combat system and the exquisite characters. The storys, especially for every single character are drawing a astoundingly deep fantacy world. I love the Chinese elements and OST of Liyue too! The game is still under developing, and I think it's very promising! P.S. Don't like the gacha part that much :P

Also, congrats to Hades for winning best independent game and action game in TGA, and a lot of other rewards! One of the best games I played this year. Good job Supergiant!

The semester finally ends, and I got some time to play the games I wanted to play!

I finished playing Katana Zero. Which is amazing! The gameplay is tense and thrilling. The story is attractive, and the way interaction is creative! If you haven't played it before, don't miss out!
